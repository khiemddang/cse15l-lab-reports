# Week 2 Lab Report

## Installing VSCode

I downloaded [Studio Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for my operating system (MacOS). Once it was installed, I should saw a window like this:

## Remotely Connecting

I opened up a new terminal in VSCode and typed this command:

> ssh cs15lsp22aag

I got a message that looks like this:

> The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
>
> RSA key fingerprint is 
>
>SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
>
>Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

And I typed "yes" into the terminal.
